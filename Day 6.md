### Day 6

First we will take all the coins from the PC, we will get 16 coins in total, So we will go to the green guy and ask him to change our name to 'AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD' and hence 16 coins we will be used and due to buffer overflow our coins section will get the value DDDD and due to the hex value we will get unattainable money.

Du to this if we go to the shopkeeper he will start questioning that how did we get so much money, etc. and hence won't let us buy the star.

So now will go back to the green guy and tell him to change our name to  'AAAAAAAAAAAABBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD123456789abcdef0' so that we will get every item possible in the game by buffer overflow.

Now we will go to the Xmas tree and get the flag by putting the star on the tree.
